after all tomorrow is another day
frankly my dear i don't give a damn
looking at you kid
how do you like them apples?
i drink your milkshake
i'll be back
i'll get you my pretty and your little dog too
if you build it he will come
it's showtime
dog burying his nose in the snow
dog catching a frisbee
dog chasing its tail
flock of geese
flower in full bloom
gorilla pounding his chest
healthy dog with a silky coat
hen sitting on her nest
herd of galloping antelopes
horse pulling a wagon
horse trotting down a beach
litter of puppies
mother bear and her cubs
pack of coyotes
pack of wolves
patch of palm trees in the desert
plethora of bird species
variety of wildlife
abundant wildlife
